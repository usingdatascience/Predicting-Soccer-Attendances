# Predicting-Soccer-Attendances

The main purpose of this project is to assist in my learning of Python, R, and general predictive modelling. Soccer/Football is one of my big passions, and in my view, the best way to help you learn is to do something that you are passionate about and interested in.

The project will attempt to create a model that will predict the attendances of Soccer matches in the English football league.

## Dataset Creation
First stage of the project will be to create a dataset that can be used, to then create a predictive model.

The first phase of this project involved looking at League One fixtures and creating a dataset within Excel for matches played in season 2016/17. The process to produce this dataset, was as stated initially a manual process, sourcing data from various websites, which was then added into an Excel spreadsheet.  This spreadsheet is "league1_2016_17_v5.xlsx"

The second phase of the project, then looked at assisting my understanding and learning of the python language. Here i created a python script, that with the aid of various other source files, when run creates a dataset for Championship matches in the same season, 2016/17.

The two datasets produced, will then be merged into one main dataset, to then be used in the modelling phase.
